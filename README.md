# Caesar-Cipher-Encryption-Decryption
One of the most common and oldest types of encryption techniques is called Caesar Cipher. Julius Caesar mainly employed this technique to communicate with his trusted allies while concealing messages from others. 
This project is a simple implementation of the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher that replaces each letter in the plaintext with a letter a certain number of positions down the alphabet.

# Working
The project is built on the fundamental logic of a numeric key value, which is used to alter the position values of individual alphabets in a text. A key of numeric number “3” is applied to plain text to shift the alphabet to the right three times eventually making the plain text encrypted into the cipher text.

# Example
To Encrypt : 
For example, if you applied Caesar cipher on the text “SECURITY” with the shift of 3, it will be converted to cipher text “VHFXULWB”.
To Decrypt :
If you want to decrypt the cipher text "VHFXULWB" with the shift of 3, it will revert back to the original text "SECURITY".

# Files
The project consists of the following files:                                                                  
a. home_page.html: The HTML file containing the user interface and JavaScript code.
b. interface_style.css: The CSS file for styling the user interface.
c. caesar_cipher.js: The JavaScript file containing the implementation of the Caesar cipher algorithm.
d. README.md: The readme file with instructions and information about the project.

# Compatibility
This Caesar cipher encryption/decryption tool should work on most modern web browsers that support JavaScript. No additional libraries or frameworks are required.
